# Time_Resolution_of_LWS_Signal

Plant diseases are one of the leading causes of loss of crops. Monitoring the plant
growth conditions could help prevent the spread of diseases and ensure healthy
agricultural productivity. A leaf wetness sensor (LWS) is used to detect wetness
on the surface of the leaves. Leaf wetness duration (LWD) is an essential parameter
that governs the possibility of the occurrence of diseases in plants. The sensor
system used in this work for monitoring the environmental conditions transmits
data every 30 minutes due to power consumption considerations. To improve the
time-resolution of the signal and accurate estimation of LWD, a deep learningbased
architecture is proposed. The data from LWS has been used to train the
architecture and the results obtained have been compared with the existing methods
to analyze its performance. Using the proposed architecture, the signal from
LWS was bench-marked with the commercially available Phythos-31. The timeresolution
of data has been improved from ± 30 minutes to ± 4 minutes. The
average SNR values for three test signals with improved time-resolution have increased
from 19.36dB to 22.16dB. Similarly, the average RMSE of the estimated
LWD values after time-resolution improved from 0.55 to 0.20. During the experimental
analysis, it has been observed that the proposed architecture estimates the
LWD values better compared to the other time-resolution techniques.
